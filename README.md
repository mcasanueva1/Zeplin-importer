# Zeplin script: Download CLM project

This command line tool utilizes the [Zeplin Node SDK](https://github.com/zeplin/javascript-sdk) download all assets in a project in a directory called "Output" and then creating a new directory within "Output" for each screen in your project. Zeplin supports SVG, PNG, PDF, JPG, and WEBP image formats depending on your project type. All formats will by download by default, but you can specify which formats you want downloaded in the command line options with `-f <formats>`. More examples below.
